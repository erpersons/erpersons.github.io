  <p>
    As a life-long learner with a voracious appetite for the written word, I need my mind to be challenged for the sake of 
    personal growth and wisdom. As a humanist, I have great love for all living things which in turn directs all of my 
    decision-making. I enjoy creative collaboration, and with my outgoing personality, I can to add humor to my interpersonal 
    interactions, as I have found this boosts creativity further.
